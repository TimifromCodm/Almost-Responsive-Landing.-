# Almost-Responsive-Landing.-
-- almost made it responsive 
but i made one huge mistake.
i was building my divs and using 
padding to push it,and giving that background 
instead of pushing the parent container 
(which i also didn't create)
basically, this is the equivalent 
of building a house on air.
